## Requirements

To use `flyingsnake`, you need [Python 3.7 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine and inside your PATH.

## Installing

`flyingsnake` is available on PyPI, so you can download it through `pip`. 

### Windows

Open either **Windows PowerShell** (Windows 10) or the **Command Prompt** (other Windows versions) and enter:

```batch
pip install flyingsnake --upgrade
```

### Linux

Enter this in your terminal:

```bash
python3.7 -m pip install flyingsnake --upgrade
```

## Usage

To create a world map image named `Output.png` from the `Small_Example.wld` file present in your current working directory, run in your terminal:

```bash
flyingsnake Small_Example.wld Output.png
```

### Layers

The world map is generated by merging together multiple layers that can be enabled/disabled through flags.

In order, those are:
- Background
- Walls
- Liquids
- Blocks
- Wires

#### Background

The background layer is made by coloring the Overworld, the Underground and the Caverns their respective background color.

It can be selected exclusively with the `--background` flag, or turned off with the `--no-background` flag.

#### Walls

The walls layer contains the colors of the walls present in the world.

It can be selected exclusively with the `--walls` flag, or turned off with the `--no-walls` flag.

If the walls are painted, they will be colored with the paint color.
You can turn off paint colors with the `--no-paints` option.

### Custom colors

By default, `flyingsnake` uses the colors defined in the [TEdit settings file](https://github.com/TEdit/Terraria-Map-Editor/blob/master/TEditXna/settings.xml).

However, you can use different colors by passing the `--colors colors.json` option to the command.

You can see an example colors file [here](https://github.com/Steffo99/flyingsnake/tree/master/flyingsnake/example_colors.json); the colors are in RGBA format, and go from 0 to 255.
